## Dev Notes
- Preview with LiveServer VSCode extension.
- Set up a workaround for Single-Page-App routing using a custom 404 page and a short script on the index file. The main benefit to this design is that we can programmatically generate skill-specific pages without having to create a pre-build process.
  - Downside is that it may still trigger browser notifications based on the 404 redirect.
- Not sure how this will interact with page views on Google analytics, but event logging should work as expected.
